  <h2>
    “Nung” is a Capstone 2 Exhibition, showcasing the works of RMIT University’ Final Year Design
    Students. The concept of the project revolves around the imagery of different types of brick
    tile and the process of making bricks. The clay has to be molded, transformed, and fired (nung)
    under great heat in order to become a finished brick, which is a metaphor for design students
    undergoing many hardships before submitting their final works, showing themselves to the world.
