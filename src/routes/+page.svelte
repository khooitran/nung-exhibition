    <h2>
      “Nung” is a Capstone 2 Exhibition, showcasing the works of RMIT University’ Final Year Design
      Students. The concept of the project revolves around the imagery of different types of brick
      tile and the process of making bricks. The clay has to be molded, transformed, and fired
      (nung) under great heat in order to become a finished brick, which is a metaphor for design
      students undergoing many hardships before submitting their final works, showing themselves to
      the world.
